# ForgeBytez 🚀

**Small indie tech studio in Chittagong, Bangladesh**

We build clean, modern, thoughtful digital things — and we only take on projects where we can deliver something we're genuinely proud of.

### What we do
- Modern web apps & websites (nice frontend + solid, fast backend)  
- Premium graphic design (posters, banners, branding, social assets…)  
- AI integration & implementation (business tools, personal projects, productivity boosts)

### Currently building
**ZenFlowz** — open-source, lightweight Pomodoro app with cozy aesthetics and some genuinely unique features (Ice Melt timer says hi 😏).  
Alpha version coming very soon — we’ll keep adding cool stuff step by step.

### A bit about how we work
We’re a tiny team, so we’re picky about projects.  
We love working with people who already have a clear idea and choose us because our style & approach feels right to them.

We grow mostly organically — through the quality of our open-source work and word-of-mouth from happy clients.

**Fun fact:** We haven’t made a single taka from ForgeBytez… yet.  
But we’re having way too much fun building to care right now 😄

### Want to work together?
If you have a clear vision and think we’d be a great match, just drop us a message.  
We reply to thoughtful inquiries — no pressure, no spam.

Small team. Real care. Zero corporate vibes (for now… or maybe forever 😉).
